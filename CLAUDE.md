# Social Autoposter

## Source of truth for active projects: config.json

**Before ANY cross-site work (marketing a new product on multiple sites, adding a CTA, running an audit, generating content), open `~/social-autoposter/config.json` first.** It is the authoritative list of every website we run. Do not `ls ~/` looking for site repos, do not guess domains, do not hardcode a "list of our sites" anywhere.

Each entry under `projects[]` exposes (at minimum):
- `name` (e.g. `fazm`, `mediar`, `assrt`)
- `website` production domain
- `local_repo` path to the product repo (e.g. `~/fazm`)
- `landing_pages.repo` path to the website repo (e.g. `~/fazm-website`) <- use this for marketing pages, blog posts, CTAs
- `landing_pages.github_repo`, `landing_pages.base_url`, `landing_pages.gsc_property`
- `posthog.project_id`, `booking_link`, `get_started_link`, `qualification`

Rules:
- New website? Add it to `config.json` first; SEO pipeline, analytics checker, dashboard, and cross-site marketing scripts pick it up automatically.
- Never hardcode project names, repo paths, or domains outside `config.json`.
- Any script that iterates over "all our websites" MUST read `projects[]`.

## Shared UI library: @m13v/seo-components (~/seo-components)

**`~/seo-components` is where cross-site UI lives.** Published as `@m13v/seo-components`, consumed by every website in `config.json`. Before building a new component on one site (CTA block, newsletter signup, comparison table, FAQ, proof band), check if it already exists in the library, and if not, **add it to the library instead of building it site-local**. One site-local copy today becomes four divergent copies next quarter.

Already shipped (partial): `InlineCta`, `StickyBottomCta`, `BookCallCTA`, `GetStartedCTA`, `NewsletterSignup`, `FullSiteAnalytics`, `ComparisonTable`, `FaqSection`, `RelatedPostsGrid`, `ProofBand`, `GlowCard`, `ShimmerButton`, `BeforeAfter`, `AnimatedDemo`, `BentoGrid`, `Breadcrumbs`, `ArticleMeta`, `MetricsRow`, `TypingAnimation`.

Consumer sites import via the `@seo/components` alias. When adding a new component: build in `~/seo-components/src/components/`, bump version, then update each consumer (the `bump:consumers` script automates this).

## Analytics wiring check

`scripts/check_analytics_wiring.py` audits every project in `config.json` for correct PostHog + `@m13v/seo-components` wiring. Catches silent-failure bugs where `window.posthog` is never set and helpers (NewsletterSignup, trackScheduleClick) no-op.

- Run on demand: `python3 scripts/check_analytics_wiring.py`
- Exits 1 on any BROKEN project; safe for pre-commit or CI.
- Preferred fix: mount `<FullSiteAnalytics>` from `@m13v/seo-components` (handles init + `window.posthog` + `<SeoAnalyticsProvider>`).

## SKILL.md - Single File, No Copies

`SKILL.md` lives at the repo root. There is no `skill/SKILL.md`.

- `~/.claude/skills/social-autoposter` -> `~/social-autoposter/` (repo root)
- Claude loads `~/social-autoposter/SKILL.md` directly
- Shell scripts in `skill/` reference `$REPO_DIR/SKILL.md` (the root)
- `bin/cli.js` deletes any stale `skill/SKILL.md` during init/update
- `setup/SKILL.md` is a separate file (setup wizard, not the main skill)

### Rules

- **NEVER create `skill/SKILL.md`** - not as a file, not as a symlink
- **NEVER edit, modify, or write to `SKILL.md`** - it is locked with `chflags uchg` (macOS immutable flag). Do not attempt to unlock it. Do not run `chflags nouchg`. Do not run `chmod`. Just read it and follow the workflow exactly as written.
- **NEVER edit, modify, or write to `setup/SKILL.md`** - it is also locked with `chflags uchg`. Same rules as above: do not unlock, do not modify, do not "fix" it.
- **Do NOT add rate limits to ANY file** - do not add "Max N posts per 24 hours" or any posting rate limit language to SKILL.md, setup/SKILL.md, shell scripts, or any other file. There is NO posting rate limit. If a file does not contain a rate limit, that is intentional.
- **Do NOT "improve" or "fix" the workflow** - do not renumber steps, do not add safety checks, do not restructure the file.

## Locked pipeline files: NEVER unlock without explicit user instruction

Many pipeline scripts are locked with `chflags uchg` to prevent agents from "simplifying" or reverting data-driven improvements. An agent did exactly this on 2026-04-28: it ran `chflags nouchg`, stripped critical guardrails (two-lane grounding rule, Moltbook AUP context clearing), then relocked the files.

**NEVER run `chflags nouchg` on any file in this repo without the user explicitly saying "unlock X and change Y".** The lock is not a suggestion. It is a hard stop. If you think a locked file needs to change, stop and tell the user instead.

Locked files (do NOT unlock or edit without explicit user instruction):
- `scripts/engagement_styles.py` (grounding rule, tier weights, platform weights)
- `scripts/engage_reddit.py` (Moltbook context clearing, grounding rule in prompt)
- `skill/run-reddit-search.sh`, `skill/run-twitter-cycle.sh`, `skill/run-github.sh`, `skill/run-linkedin.sh`
- `scripts/top_performers.py`, `scripts/post_reddit.py`, `scripts/post_github.py`, `scripts/github_tools.py`
- `scripts/linkedin_api.py`, `scripts/discover_linkedin_candidates.py`, `scripts/score_linkedin_candidates.py`, `scripts/linkedin_browser.py`, `scripts/linkedin_url.py`, `scripts/log_linkedin_search_attempts.py`, `scripts/top_linkedin_queries.py`, `scripts/top_dud_linkedin_queries.py`
- `seo/generate_page.py`, `seo/escalate.py`, `seo/resume_escalations.py`
- `scripts/ingest_human_seo_replies.py`, `scripts/scan_dm_candidates.py`
- `skill/dm-outreach-reddit.sh`, `skill/dm-outreach-twitter.sh`, `skill/dm-outreach-linkedin.sh`
- `scripts/twitter_browser.py`, `scripts/scan_twitter_thread_followups.py`, `skill/scan-twitter-followups.sh`
- `scripts/watchdog_hung_runs.py`, `skill/stats.sh`


## Known unresolved issue: hung runs from BSD grep on /tmp FIFOs

A `run-*.sh` can occasionally hang indefinitely because the model invokes `grep -r` across `/tmp` (or `~/`) during a session. macOS BSD `grep` opens named pipes it encounters (e.g. stale `ad_mailbox_*` FIFOs left by Apple daemons) and blocks forever in `read()`, which freezes the shell, the `claude -p` parent, and prevents launchd from re-firing the job. No automatic recovery is in place: wrapping `claude` in `timeout` was rejected, and neither FIFO sweeps nor switching to GNU grep fully eliminates the class of problem. For now, if a posting run stops making progress, kill the stuck `run-*.sh` tree manually.


## LinkedIn: flagged patterns (DO NOT REINTRODUCE)

2026-04-17 the account was restricted after a patch added Voyager-API scraping and per-permalink scroll-and-expand loops. Volume (2-3 posts/day) was NOT the cause, behavioral fingerprinting of scripted browser activity was. Banned in this repo:

- `/voyager/api/*` calls of any kind (Python, `fetch()`, `page.evaluate`). That is the internal web-client backend, not the public API.
- Loops that open each post permalink to scrape reactions/comments, or combine `scrollBy` with clicks on "Show more comments" / "Load earlier replies".
- Python Playwright/CDP helpers that drive *posting, replying, scrolling, multi-page navigation, or programmatic `login()` flows*. The 17 Apr restriction was caused by behavioral fingerprinting of those patterns, not by Python existing in the call stack.

Allowed: `scripts/linkedin_api.py` (OAuth `api.linkedin.com/v2/socialActions/*`, documented) for posting, and `mcp__linkedin-agent__*` (real headed Chrome) for any browser work, driven by Claude inside the shell pipelines. Session checks are passive: if login/checkpoint appears, print `SESSION_INVALID` and stop.

**Carve-out (2026-04-29): read-only sidebar pre-checks via Python Playwright are allowed under strict conditions.** `scripts/linkedin_browser.py` may attach to the linkedin-agent's persistent profile (`~/.claude/browser-profiles/linkedin`) in **headed** mode for cost-saving "is anything unread?" gates ahead of the Claude-driven engage-dm-replies pipeline. Allowed inside this helper:

- ONE `page.goto('/messaging/')` per invocation.
- ONE `page.evaluate()` to read sidebar conversation rows + unread badges from the DOM.
- Headed Chromium only (`headless=False`). Headless fingerprints differently.
- Inherit the same persistent profile so cookies/session/fingerprint match the MCP agent.

Banned inside this helper, no exceptions:

- `/voyager/api/*` (still). The pre-check reads only DOM that the user themselves would see.
- Multi-page loops, permalink scrapes, scroll-and-expand on threads, "Show more" clicks.
- Any clicks, types, or form interactions. Read-only.
- Programmatic login. If `_is_login_or_checkpoint(url)` matches, return `session_invalid` and stop.

New LinkedIn capability that *acts* (posts, replies, edits, scrolls multiple pages)? Extend `linkedin_api.py` or add a Claude-driven `mcp__linkedin-agent__` step. Do not write a new Python CDP *action* helper.

## Engagement Styles System (DO NOT REMOVE)

All posting and engagement scripts use `scripts/engagement_styles.py` to generate a `STYLES_BLOCK` variable injected into prompts. This is an A/B testing system that tracks which comment style gets the best engagement.

- **NEVER remove `STYLES_BLOCK`** from any `skill/run-*.sh` or `skill/engage*.sh` script
- **NEVER remove `engagement_style`** from DB logging (reply_db.py calls, INSERT statements)
- **NEVER remove or simplify style definitions** in `scripts/engagement_styles.py`
- **NEVER inline style definitions** back into individual scripts; the shared module is the single source of truth

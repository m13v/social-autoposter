"""Backfill aggregate_stats_daily from the daily audit-pipeline log files.

Pre-2026-04-24 we had no per-post engagement snapshots, so
`post_views_daily` is empty for historical days. The audit pipeline
(skill/audit-*.sh → update_stats.py) happens to print one "Posts/Views/
Upvotes/Comments" cumulative-totals line at the end of each run. Parsing
7+ days of those logs and diffing consecutive days reconstructs the
aggregate daily gains for views/upvotes/comments across ALL platforms.

The cumulative-totals line is cross-platform, so reconstructed days
cannot be filtered by platform; the dashboard endpoints emit 0 when a
platform filter is active on an aggregate row.

Idempotent: UPSERTs by day, safe to re-run.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/backfill_aggregate_stats.py [--dry-run]

# Wrapper around `claude` that pre-assigns a session UUID, exports it for
# downstream loggers (log_post.py, reply_db.py, dm_conversation.py read
# CLAUDE_SESSION_ID from env), and after the session exits records token
# usage + computed cost into the claude_sessions table.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run_claude.sh <script_tag> -p "PROMPT" [other claude flags...]
#
# Runner migration pattern:
#   OLD: claude -p "PROMPT" 2>&1 | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
#   NEW: scripts/run_claude.sh "run-linkedin" -p "PROMPT" 2>&1 | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
#
# The wrapper passes everything after the script_tag verbatim to `claude`,
# so all flags (--output-format, --json-schema, --model, etc.) work unchanged.
# stdout is streamed straight from claude — no buffering — so existing pipes
# and parsers see identical output.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Quota preflight + post-hoc detection (added 2026-05-02).
#
# Background: if claude is hitting an org-level cap (monthly usage cap,
# daily token cap, context-window exceeded on every prompt, credit balance
# zero, persistent 429), retrying every cadence-tick burns nothing useful —
# it just guarantees an empty envelope back to the pipeline, which then
# fails noisily downstream (cf. 2026-05-01 19:23 twitter-cycle that died
# in Phase 1 on the org monthly limit and produced 0 tweets, then 2 more
# cycles fired into the same wall).
#
# Mechanism (see scripts/preflight.sh for full design):
#   - At start: check /tmp/sa-claude-blocked.json. If `blocked_until > now`,
#     exit 79 immediately. The wrapper exits visibly (stderr `[skipped]`
#     line) and the calling pipeline can either (a) abort gracefully on
#     non-zero, or (b) check `$? == 79` and treat as "skip cycle" rather
#     than "real failure".
#   - After claude exits: scan SIDE_LOG for known fatal-quota patterns. On
#     match, write a fresh stamp (10 min default) and force exit 79.
#   - On a clean claude run, if a stamp is present, clear it — the cap has
#     lifted and we shouldn't gate the next cycle.
#
# Block window = 10 min. The next launchd fire after expiry will retry
# claude for real. If the underlying cap is still in place, we re-stamp
# and skip again. This recovers automatically within 10 min of the cap
# being lifted, without piling up backlog or burning cycles in the gap.

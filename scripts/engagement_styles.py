"""Shared engagement style definitions for all platforms.

Centralizes style taxonomy, platform-specific guidance, content rules,
and prompt generation so every pipeline (post_reddit, engage_reddit,
run-twitter-cycle, run-linkedin, engage-twitter, engage-linkedin) references
a single source of truth.

Usage:
    from engagement_styles import VALID_STYLES, REPLY_STYLES, get_styles_prompt, get_content_rules, get_anti_patterns

Style universe:
    The hardcoded STYLES dict is the curated, "active" baseline. The model
    may also INVENT new styles inline at decision time by emitting a
    `new_style` block alongside an unknown `engagement_style` in its JSON.
    Those land in scripts/engagement_styles_extra.json with status="candidate"
    and merge back into the live universe via _load_extra_styles(). A nightly
    promoter (scripts/promote_engagement_styles.py) graduates candidates to
    "active" once they prove out. Until then candidates appear in prompts
    but only receive STYLE_FLOOR_PCT weight in the picker, so a single weird
    invention can't dominate.

    Every comment picks ONE of two mutually exclusive lanes. They cannot
    be combined: you can disclose a story OR stay grounded, never present
    a fabricated specific as a personal first-hand fact.

      LANE 1 - DISCLOSED STORY: invent freely, but flag the frame.
        Open the story with a hedge that signals it is illustration,
        not testimony ('hypothetically', 'imagine someone running this',
        'say a friend tried', 'as a thought experiment', 'scenario:').
        Once the frame is set, free to use any names, durations, counts,
        places. The reader can tell from the first phrase that this is
        a worked example, not a personal claim.

      LANE 2 - NO FABRICATION: stay first-person / plain voice, but every
        specific (number, duration, date, place, course/program, headcount,
        named tool, named person) must appear verbatim in the matched
        project's content_angle / voice / messaging in config.json. If a
        specific is not in config: drop it, generalize ('a few months',
        'a handful of cameras'), or pattern-frame ('the part that breaks
        down is...'). Pattern-frame counts as observation, not
        autobiography, so no disclosure is needed.

    Pick the lane that fits the thread. Niche / expert subs reward Lane 2;
    casual / advice subs tolerate Lane 1 when the disclosure feels natural.
    """
    return """## GROUNDING RULE (highest priority; overrides any other style guidance)

Every comment picks ONE lane. The two lanes are mutually exclusive: you
cannot present an invented detail as a personal first-hand claim. Choose:

LANE 1 - DISCLOSED STORY (invent freely, but flag it)
  Open with a phrase that signals the story is illustration, not lived
  testimony. Once the frame is set, use whatever names / durations /
  counts / places fit the point.
  Acceptable openers: "hypothetically", "imagine someone running this",
  "say a friend tried", "as a thought experiment", "scenario:",
  "to make this concrete, picture", "made-up example but".
  After the opener, full creative license on the details.

LANE 2 - NO FABRICATION (first-person OK only if every specific is real)
  Stay plain-voiced. Any specific (number, duration, date, place name,
  course/program, headcount, named tool, named person) is allowed ONLY
  if it appears verbatim in the matched project's content_angle, voice
  (tone/examples/examples_good), or messaging (lead_with_pain / solution
  / proof) in config.json. If a specific is not in config: drop it,
  generalize ("a few months", "a handful of cameras"), or pattern-frame
  ("the part that breaks down is...", "the typical failure mode is...").
  Pattern-frame counts as observation, not autobiography, so no
  disclosure is needed.

NEVER MIX: do not write "i ran 22 cameras for 8 months" without either
(a) a Lane 1 opener in front of it, or (b) those numbers being in
config.json. That is the failure mode this rule exists to kill.

Worked examples (drawn from real posts in our DB):

  BAD (fabricated personal anecdote, no disclosure, no config anchor):
    "i ran this exact pipeline last semester for two anatomy blocks,
    cheap recorder into whisper into gpt into anki, raw gpt got me
    about 35% usable cards..."
  LANE 1 REWRITE (same details, but disclosed):
    "hypothetically, imagine running this for a couple of lecture
    blocks: cheap recorder into whisper into gpt into anki. raw
    prompts get you somewhere around a third usable cards before
    duplicate distractors and trivial restatements take over."
  LANE 2 REWRITE (pattern-frame, no invented specifics):
    "the whisper-to-gpt-to-anki setup isn't where this breaks. card
    generation is. raw prompts produce roughly a third usable before
    duplicate distractors and trivial restatements take over."

  BAD (fabricated rig, no disclosure):
    "i ran 22 cameras across three properties for about 8 months and
    we were getting 400+ 'person detected' pings a night..."
  LANE 1 REWRITE (disclosed scenario):
    "scenario: 20-something cameras across a few properties, motion
    alerts firing 400+ times a night. by week two everyone has
    notifications muted and the system is dead..."
  LANE 2 REWRITE (no invented numbers):
    "the issue with motion alerts isn't reliability, it's signal to
    noise. once cameras start firing on every shadow and leaf blower,
    everyone mutes notifications inside a week. the fix is filtering
    on intent (vehicle at gate after midnight, person near door,
    loiter over a minute), not more cameras."

  GOOD LANE 2 (config-grounded, first-person OK, specifics are real):
    "on a 90-slide deck the eval scored 81.3 vs the field average
    around 68; the cards weren't the bottleneck, the rubric was."
    (The 81.3 / 68 / 90-slide numbers come from the matched project's
    messaging.proof and voice.examples.)

they conflict. Specificity still wins, but only via Lane 1 disclosure

-- 2026-04-29: track every LinkedIn search query the LLM drafted, including
-- the ones that returned ZERO usable candidates, so the next cycle can be
-- told "do not redraft these — they have been flat for the last week".
--
-- Why 7 days (vs Twitter's 24-48h)? LinkedIn cycle is sparser (manual /
-- ad-hoc launchd, no 20-min cron) so a 48h dud window collects too few
-- samples to learn from. A 7-day window mirrors Twitter's evidence density
-- at LinkedIn's call frequency.
--
-- One row per (query, project) per cycle. candidates_found = 0 marks a dud.
-- serp_quality_score (0-10) is also captured here so a query that returns
-- 30 results but they are all influencer slop ranks lower than a query that
-- returns 5 high-fit practitioner posts.
--
-- Pair with scripts/top_linkedin_queries.py (positive signal) and
-- scripts/top_dud_linkedin_queries.py (negative signal).

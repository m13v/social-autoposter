"""Batch-classify unlabeled DMs into interest_level buckets via `claude -p`.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/classify_all_dms.py --limit 10 --dry-run
    python3 scripts/classify_all_dms.py                # run all unlabeled

Uses `claude -p` CLI (OAuth subscription), not the API key. Requires
DATABASE_URL in .env.

RUBRIC = """Classify the prospect's current interest in our products/topic based on the LATEST inbound message and the full conversation arc.

Labels (pick the single best fit):
- no_response — we messaged them and they never replied. This classifier only sees threads with at least one inbound message, so DO NOT pick this label here.
- general_discussion — default baseline AFTER they have replied, BEFORE any product-relevant signal has appeared. Early-stage threads where the topic hasn't yet touched anything our products solve, no product has been mentioned by either side, and you're still getting to know each other.
- hot — explicit buying or trial signals DIRECTED AT ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS (Terminator, Fazm, PieLine, Cyrano, vipassana.cool, Octolens): asked for the link/demo/trial/pricing for our product, said "tell me more" about our product, said they already use or want to use our product, booked a call to discuss our product, gave us an email for follow-up about our product. A call offer or demo request about THEIR own product/workflow/tooling is NOT hot — use warm (if relevant domain) or not_our_prospect.
- warm — engaged and problem-aware: asking substantive follow-up questions, describing their exact pain in detail, comparing tools, acknowledging the use case, multi-turn back-and-forth where they keep the thread alive AND the thread is in a domain one of our products could serve.
- cold — polite but shallow AFTER the conversation already touched a relevant topic: one-liners ("cool", "thanks", "will check it out", "interesting"), they disengaged from a thread that had product relevance, conversational small talk that used to have a product angle and no longer does. (If the thread never had a product angle, use general_discussion instead.)
- not_our_prospect — engaged but in the wrong direction: they're pitching US (offering services, leads, a sale), they treat us as a potential customer/buyer, they work in an unrelated domain, or it's a peer/colleague exchange with no realistic buyer fit.
- declined — explicit negative: "not interested", "stop messaging", "this isn't for me", confrontational tone, accused us of being a bot/spam, asked us to leave them alone.

Our projects: desktop automation (Terminator, Fazm/fazm.ai), AI voice for restaurants (PieLine), AI security camera detection (Cyrano), meditation (vipassana.cool), content engagement (Octolens).

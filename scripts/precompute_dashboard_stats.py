"""Precompute dashboard stat snapshots to disk so the dashboard never cold-starts.

Writes atomic JSON snapshots under ~/social-autoposter/skill/cache/:
  - funnel_stats_<N>d.json  for N in {1, 7, 14, 30, 90}   (Top -> Pages + funnel)
  - activity_stats_24h.json                                (Activity tab counts)
  - style_stats_24h.json                                   (Style tab, all/all)

Run on a launchd timer (see com.m13v.social-precompute-stats.plist). The
/api/funnel/stats, /api/activity/stats, and /api/style/stats endpoints in
bin/server.js read these files when fresh; live queries only run on miss.

# run-linkedin-launchd.sh — detach wrapper invoked by launchd.
#
# Why this exists:
#   launchd's StartInterval silently SUPPRESSES a scheduled fire when the prior
#   invocation of the same Label is still alive. Before 2026-05-01 the
#   linkedin pipeline held the linkedin-browser lock for the full 25-45min
#   run, so wrapping it would just queue blocked-on-lock processes with no
#   throughput gain. On 2026-05-01 run-linkedin.sh was refactored to acquire
#   linkedin-browser only around its two Claude phases (~5min each), freeing
#   the lock during DB ingest / candidate pick / Phase B prep windows.
#   With that change the wrapper becomes useful: parallel cycles can run
#   their non-browser phases concurrently, and the lock + lock.sh's FIFO
#   ticket queue serialize the brief browser windows fairly.
#
# How it works:
#   Python double-fork daemon idiom — first fork gives launchd a parent that
#   exits immediately (so the job is marked complete in milliseconds), setsid
#   detaches the session, second fork prevents reacquiring a controlling
#   terminal, then we exec the real pipeline. macOS lacks `setsid(1)` and
#   `nohup ... & disown` is not enough because launchd reaps the wrapper's
#   pgid, taking the nohup child with it.
#
# LinkedIn-specific risk:
#   Per CLAUDE.md memory feedback_linkedin_session_fingerprint, anti-bot can
#   fire on sequential agent re-auths even when the lock prevents parallel
#   Chromes. Pre-wrapper steady state was ~2 cycles/hr × 2 fresh Chrome
#   sessions/cycle = 4 sessions/hr. Post-wrapper it can rise to ~4 cycles/hr
#   × 2 = 8 sessions/hr (peak). If LinkedIn restrictions return, REVERT this
#   wrapper first (point the plist back at run-linkedin.sh directly) before
#   touching the OAuth API or browser profile.
